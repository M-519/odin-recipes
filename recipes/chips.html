    <h2>Home made, baked potato chips. The perfect snack for any time of the day.</h2>
 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Butter or Sunflower Oil</li>
        <li>Salt or other species</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You can start by turning your over in order to pre-heat it. I will recommend 500F or 260C.</li>
        <li>The very first step will be to rinse your potatoes.</li>
        <li>Once they are clean, you need to peel them and then wash them again.</li>
        <li>It's time to slice the potato, they need to be as thin as possible in order to become crisp.</li>
        <li>The following step is to arrange them on paper towel to drain their natural moisture</li>
        <li>When dry, you can brush both a baking tray with butter and then arrange them.</li>
        <li>Depending on your preferences you can also brush the tops of the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake tha potatoes in center of the over for 15 to 20 minutes or until the sides turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>They are ready. You can add salt and other species of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
